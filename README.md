+Introduction
+------------
+This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.
+It contains a Code Book (CodeBook.md) with key insights on what the R code does with the data, as well as the data source
+The source R code is included in run_analysis.R
+The resulting dataset (tidydataset.txt) as per what is explained in the Code Book, is also in the repo.
